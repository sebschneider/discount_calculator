# discount_calculator

This is a simple Android app that allows the user to calculate how much money a certain discount percentage means. 
Whereas the challenge seems simple enough, the main reasons for developing this app were:
- to get hands-on experience on UI from beginning to end, using Kivy
- to be able to package the app for Android using Buildozer
- to be able to implement Google Admob using Kivmob

## main.py

This is the main Python code, which deals mainly with the logical aspects of the app.

## discount.kv

This is the Kivy file, where the design code was mainly developed.

## buildozer.spec

This is an example of a buildozer.spec file. Note that buildozer must be correctly deployed before building.
